# My dotfiles for unix systems
Config for bash, vim, zsh, .... I use everywhere the same stack.
Unix-systems I use are always based on Debian or Ubuntu. The only
exceptions are MacOS and "git for windows bash"/MINGW64.

Common command line utilities that I use everywhere:
- micro as terminal editor (https://micro-editor.github.io/)
- zsh with "oh my zsh" insteas of bash (https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- bat as better cat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- delta as git diff viewer (this is also used in)
- httpie as http-focused curl (https://github.com/httpie/httpie)
- ripgrep as better grep (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- exa as modern ls replacement (https://github.com/ogham/exa)
