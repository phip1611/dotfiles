# Common System Configurations

**Update 2023**

Since I move all machines I'm primarily working on to `NixOS`, my configurations
and dotfiles can now be found here:

Here I collect my common configurations of systems, including but not limited to
UNIX dotfiles, Windows configurations, lists of common packages and
applications, and module-based NixOS configurations.
